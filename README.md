This project, is my graduation project. It’s designed to help improve security and make reporting much easier in places like universities, offices, or any secure location.

The system uses AI and face recognition to detect and classify people into two categories: authorized and unauthorized. When an authorized person is recognized, the system logs their name, timestamp, and a photo. If someone unauthorized shows up, their picture and timestamp are saved so security can review it later.

There’s also a mobile app that security guards can use to view all the logs. They can check images, timestamps, and even filter the data by specific dates to see who entered on certain days. This makes their job a lot easier and faster.

The project combines AI technology, databases, and mobile app development to create a smart and practical solution for managing security. It’s a system that’s not only functional but also relevant for today’s world.
